# Exercise1-Implement-the-sort-algorithms
Based on the class pseudocodes, implement each of the sorts in C, adapt the program to receive a given N per argument, and then read the N numbers to sort. On program exit, it should display the list of numbers in order. Generate a report indicating the times required to sort the following N's [1000, 5000, 10000] in the 6 algorithms using the files of 10 thousand numbers and 1 million numbers.
