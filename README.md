# Exercise1-Implement-the-sort-algorithms
Based on the class pseudocodes, implement each of the orderings in C, adapt the program to receive an N given by argument and then read the N numbers to be ordered. At the exit of the program, it should display the list of numbers in order. Generate a report indicating the times required to order the following N's [1000, 5000, 10000] in the 6 algorithms.
